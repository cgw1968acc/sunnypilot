# Two ways to engage (driver 2026-09-30 night, modelled on the factory EPB hold of the Corolla Cross):
#  - firm press at the stop: BRAKE_HOLD_ALLOWED_TIMER after the moment the brake force first reaches
#    BRAKE_HOLD_MIN_FORCE while standing still;
#  - no firm press: BRAKE_HOLD_LIGHT_TIMER after the wheels stopped.
# The hold's pre-brake clamp is a step (PBRTRGR, not a ramped request). rlog 000000dc-e0: with the old fixed 1 s after
# the standstill flag it showed as a -0.4..-0.6 m/s^2 jolt on 2 of 8 light manual stops, felt as part of stopping;
# the light stop then waited 2.5 s. Since the standstill flag comes from the wheel pulse counter (the car really
# stands), the waits are no longer needed (driver 2026-10-03, after a slope stop where the hold came 2.5 s late and he
# had to stomp: "with a real wheel-stop signal the delay is unnecessary, never more than 0.2 s"): 0.1 s after a firm
# press, 0.2 s after a light stop.
# Route 000000ee 2026-10-03 (23 held manual stops, hold_timing.py): the standstill flag came a median 0.42 s after
# the last wheel pulse, the hold 0.2 s after that, and the wheels never turned forward after a hold - but the body
# was still settling: the IMU came to rest a median 0.54 s (p75 ~0.7 s) after the flag, so the 1000-1400 -> 2040 N
# clamp landed under the driver's foot during the nod and felt like an intervention. Driver: "engage only when the
# wheels are certainly not turning; if it still cuts in before the real stop, delay it to the real stop - the system
# must determine the time from the data". The light stop therefore waits 0.7 s after the flag (~1.1 s after the last
# pulse, past the settle in 3 of 4 stops); a firm press 0.3 s.
BRAKE_HOLD_ALLOWED_TIMER = 30  # frames (0.3 s) after the firm press
# Like the factory electronic-parking-brake hold (Corolla Cross), the hold only arms when the driver has pressed the
# pedal firmly at the stop: brake pressure (BRAKE 0xA6 BRAKE_FORCE) must reach BRAKE_HOLD_MIN_FORCE at some point
# during the standstill. Altis 2026-09-30 night: an ordinary light stop sits at 600-1050 N, a deliberate firm press is
# well above. A light stop stays unheld, so nothing is clamped under a driver who is just easing to a halt. When the
# car does not broadcast the force (nan) the hold arms as before.
BRAKE_HOLD_MIN_FORCE = 1400.0  # N
# ... and without a firm press the hold still engages once the car has stood still this long (driver 2026-09-30:
# a long stop at a light should be held too, a short creep-stop should not)
BRAKE_HOLD_LIGHT_TIMER = 70  # frames (0.7 s)
# ... but only if the driver is holding the car with at least this force at that moment (driver 2026-10-02, after the
# 22:30 four-bookmark stop): pressing ~760-800 N the brake only just balanced the hybrid's creep torque, so when the hold
# clamped to its fixed ~1360 N the body rocked (IMU +0.61 / -0.42); at 960 N (21:17:44, 00:13:48) the same clamp was not
# felt. Lighter than this the hold waits (it engages as soon as the driver presses a little more); released lightly, the
# car creeps as it would without the hold. Once engaged the hold stays on whatever the pedal does.
BRAKE_HOLD_LIGHT_MIN_FORCE = 900.0  # N
# Both timers count from the REAL stop (driver 2026-10-01 22:30, four bookmarks: a very slow, very gentle manual stop
# and the hold "suddenly cut in" while the car still rolled below the ~0.5 km/h wheel-speed floor). The standstill flag
# now comes from the wheel pulse counter as well (wheel_pulse.py): while the car still creeps it is not standstill, so
# these timers restart until it really stands.
# Once ENGAGED the hold must not give up at the first wheel pulse. Route 000000ec 2026-10-03 23:51:59 and 23:52:06
# (steep downhill, driver's bookmarks): the driver lifted off, the hold clamped its fixed ~1360 N, 0.4-0.7 s later the
# pulse counter stepped once (the car gave a few cm), standstill went false, the old code dropped the hold at once, the
# PCM released the brake entirely and the car rolled away freely (0 -> 6-11 km/h at ~1.7 m/s^2 with no pedal) until
# the driver caught it. Driver: "I felt the car held, then the slope was too steep, the hold gave up and it slid
# forward". So the hold now stays on while the WHEEL SPEEDS still read zero (the window in which panda lets the 0x344
# override through at all: toyota_tx_hook refuses it once vehicle_moving), whatever the pulse counter says; a creep
# before engagement still restarts the timers. On a slope where 1360 N is less than the grade force the PCM's hold
# cannot physically hold the car - it can only drag - and the driver must keep the pedal; a stronger hold needs ACC
# engaged (stopAccel) or a different PCM channel.

DISALLOWED_GEARS = (GearShifter.park, GearShifter.reverse)

# The hold message is PRE_COLLISION_2 with PBRTRGR set and DSS1GDRV, the PCS deceleration request (signed 10 bit,
# 0.1 m/s^2 per count). The original code wrote the magic 0x3FF, which packs to raw -10 = -1.0 m/s^2; the PCM answers
# that with a fixed ~1360 N (BRAKE 0xA6), not enough on a steep slope (000000ec 23:51:59: rolled away at ~1.7 m/s^2).
# Driver 2026-10-03: "can the hold not ask for more, say 1800 N?" - untested whether the PCM scales the clamp with
# this request; try -1.5 / -2.0 here parked on a flat lot and read 0xA6 before relying on it.
# Owner 2026-10-05: "can the system tell that it stopped on a slope, and only then clamp harder; on the flat keep the old
# force". carControl.orientationNED pitch (deg, + = nose up) at every stop of routes ec/ee/f2 (pitch_at_stops.py):
# flat stops sit at +0.5..+1.9 (mount/crown bias ~+1.0), the 2026-10-03 roll-aways at -6.4..-9.3, ramps and driveways
# at -2.5..-3.9 and +2.8..+4.0. Slope = |pitch - FLAT_PITCH_DEG| >= SLOPE_PITCH_DEG, decided when the hold engages and
# kept for that hold (no flip-flop while held). Flat: the old -1.0 request (~1360 N); slope: -1.5 (~2040 N, confirmed
# holding on the 10-03 hill on 2026-10-04).

SLOPE_PITCH_DEG = 2.0  # deg away from flat that counts as a slope (either direction)
# Pitch-scaled hold (owner 2026-10-09, route 00000118 00:03:39, parking-garage ramp at -9.2 deg, D gear: the hold
# engaged at -1.5 (2040 N) as the driver lifted from 3760 N, held 1.1 s, then the grade plus the creep torque turned the
# wheels; once the wheels move panda refuses the 0x344 override (vehicle_moving), the PCM let go (0 N) and the car
# rolled to 6 km/h until the driver braked. At -8.3 / -8.4 deg (00:03:56, 00:04:09) the same 2040 N held; the driver
# alone held -9.2 deg at 2600 N. Owner: "find the cause; is there room for more force on a slope?" -> "do it".)
# The request now follows the grade: -(HOLD_BASE + HOLD_PER_G * g * sin|pitch - flat|), clipped to HOLD_MIN..HOLD_MAX:
# flat -1.0 (unchanged), 4 deg -1.5 (as before), 8 deg ~-2.4 (~3300 N), 10 deg ~-2.8. On a slope it is also never
# lighter than the force the driver was holding (DSS1GDRV ~ BRAKE_HOLD_N_PER_DECEL N per m/s^2). UNTESTED above -1.5:
# check BRAKE 0xA6 on the first slope holds that the PCM honours the larger request.

# Route 00000100 2026-10-05 19:53:53 (driver's bookmarks "3+1", manual stop): the wheels stopped, the IMU settled in
# 0.13 s, no wheel pulse after the hold - the stop detection was right. The jerk was the clamp itself: the driver's
# foot crept from 640 to 920 N, crossed BRAKE_HOLD_LIGHT_MIN_FORCE 1.4 s after the stop, and the hold stepped the brake
# 920 -> 1360 N under the foot (IMU fore/aft wiggle for 0.6 s). Delaying the hold only moves that step. Owner
# 2026-10-06 chose both fixes:
#  B) while the driver is still holding the car, the hold waits; it takes over when the driver starts to LIFT: the
#     brake force falls BRAKE_HOLD_LIFT_DROP below the highest force of this stop, or the pedal is released (the
#     factory hold of the Corolla Cross takes over the same way, the car never feels it);
#  A) the clamp then starts at the force the driver was holding (DSS1GDRV ~ BRAKE_HOLD_N_PER_DECEL N per m/s^2:
#     -1.0 -> ~1360 N, -1.5 -> ~2040 N measured) and ramps to the flat/slope request over BRAKE_HOLD_RAMP_FRAMES,
#     never starting below BRAKE_HOLD_START_DECEL (~820 N, above the ~760-800 N the hybrid's creep torque needs).
#     Requests lighter than -1.0 are untested on the PCM: check 0xA6 on the first stops.
# With the hand-over at the driver's own force there is no step, so the light-stop force gate (900 N) is no longer used.
