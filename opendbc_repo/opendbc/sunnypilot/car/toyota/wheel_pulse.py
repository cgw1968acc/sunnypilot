"""
Wheel pulse creep detection (Toyota SPEED 0xB4 ENCODER).

The wheel speeds read 0 below ~0.5 km/h, so the standstill flag is set while a slowly braking car still rolls. The
wheel pulse counter keeps counting: C3X route 000000e6 calibration 0.049 m per count, forward steps of 4 counts
(~0.2 m), backward steps of -1 (a rebound at the stop). Normal openpilot stops show no forward step after the wheel
speeds read 0 (the car stops 0.2-0.6 s later within the last step); a forward step there proves the car is still
creeping (driver 2026-10-01 22:30: a very slow manual stop, the auto brake hold cut in while it still rolled).
Driver: "from now on the wheel pulses should be used".

While the wheel speeds read 0, a forward step yields a creep speed of (distance of the step) / (time since the previous
step), capped at the speed floor, that decays as one step's distance over the time since the step and is dropped
CREEP_HOLD_T after it. The car state reports this speed (so standstill is False) - every consumer of standstill
and vEgo (longcontrol hold/creep response, stop-gap governor, auto brake hold) then sees the creep.
