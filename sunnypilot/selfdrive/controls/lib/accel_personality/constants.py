Acceleration Personality tuning tables. The controller shapes only what the longitudinal MPC CONSUMES
(the positive-accel ceiling + its open-rate, and an add-only follow-gap widen fed to the MPC's t_follow);
it never post-shapes the MPC's output accel. Disabled => every getter returns the upstream stock value,
so off == byte-stock.
